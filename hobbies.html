                    I have a strong passion for making artwork and character design. It's always very fun to sit down and think for hours about how I want a certain character to look, given their established personality, and then put it down onto a drawing tablet and iterate further. Sometimes some changes are made to prior characterwork to fit with the new visualisation of the character, which is always fun.

                    Ever since I was young, I've always taken a liking to specific musical theatre styles. I think my first real musical experience was Hamilton, but before that, I had taken Speech and Drama class and had sung Disney musical songs for things like Choir, which were always quite fun. Recently, I've actually been uploading my singing to places like YouTube and Soundcloud, though it's not very good. There's a link below to an unlisted YouTube video that I performed with two friends - I was the blue guy.

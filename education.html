                    My Primary School!

                <p>
                    I went to Sengkang Green Primary School, where I joined the Choir CCA and competed in SYF, sometime in 2018 or 19, I don't quite remember, and Google isn't doing me many favours. I don't remember much else about my time in Sengkang Green, unfortunately, only that I was initially in Robotics before switching to Choir. In no particular order, I would say my notable achievements in Primary School would be:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I received a scholarship from doing well in Primary 5
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We (as in me and the choir) scored a Silver for SYF when we competed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I got a decent PSLE score. Decent, being 227 roughly.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h1>
                    My Secondary School!
                </h1>
                <p>
                    After Primary School, I entered my Secondary School, Bowen Sec, through my PSLE scores. I had previously attempted a DSA, but I failed the interview. Still, I managed and got into the Express course. I ended up taking A Math, Pure Physics, Combined Biology-Chemistry and Combined Humanities (History + Social Studies). Of those subjects, I believe I had the most success in History and Biology initially, then I caught up with A Math rapidly in Sec 4. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond plain academics, I was also in the Choir CCA for all of my Secondary School life, and it was absolutely fantastic. Our two instructors took their jobs very seriously, and it was never boring. I remember also that I had actually started going for extra classes in Secondary School, and it was extremely helpful for me academically. I excelled in Maths and Sciences, which eventually led me to choosing to pursue Game Development in Poly. If I had to give a top 3 achievements in Secondary School, I would say:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Passing Chinese with a C6
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Passing A Math with I think a B3 and passing BioChem with a B4 for O levels
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When I went with the Choir to compete in SYF 2023 and we got a Merit, which was I think a first for our school
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    And onto my current place of education! After Secondary School, I entered Nanyang Polytechnic's School of Design and Media through the EAE programme, which I passed through my knowledge of mathematics and code. Through GDT, I have honed my coding ability and learned other coding languages like C++, SQL and C#. I have also become familiar with game engines like Pico8 and Unity, and I have yet to learn more and more. The opportunities given to me are vast and I intend to make the most of them as much as possible. If I had to make a list of things I hope to do with what I am learning in Poly, I would say...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Code my own video game in Unity or Unreal Engine
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Develop mods for existing games using C++ and C# and Python
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create plugins for platforms like YouTube and Discord that improve the end user experience
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make a game within a website using HTML and CSS
                    </li>

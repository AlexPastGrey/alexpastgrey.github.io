                    My background!

                <p>
                    I was born in Singapore and raised in Singapore. As of writing this, half of my life was spent with only one parent, and I have been thrown from counsellor to therapist to IMH throughout my life. However, I am highly skilled in graphic design, mixing and editing as I have always had an interest in production of the arts, such as filmmaking and playwrighting.

                <h1>
                    My aspirations!
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I hope that one day I will be able to combine my skills in coding with my skills in graphic design and video editing such that I could create an interactive fantasy ARG about a fantastical realm accidentally crossing over into reality a little bit. I have always had a taste for fantasy and to some extent, video games, so this would be a fun project to undertake

            <div class="textbox" id="Friendmily">
                <h1>
                    My friends and family!
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I don't tend to keep a lot of friends (in my basement) but I do make acquaintances very easily. I have fairly few close friends in general though. I would say, within the context of this assignment, a few friends in my class would be Zhi Heng, Dylan C., Klaus, Mathea and some others. Outside of this assignment, I'd be naming names like Aspen and Rose and Jorden, people that would be foreign to whoever is reading this, so I'll refrain from keeping a whole list. My family situation on the other hand is quite...difficult, and I would prefer not to go into it as it is fairly uncomfortable for me to talk about. Main points are that my mom is a single mom because my dad died in 2017, and I live with my paternal grandparents.
